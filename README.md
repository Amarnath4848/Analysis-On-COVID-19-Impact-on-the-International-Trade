# Analysis-On-COVID-19-Impact-on-the-International-Trade
social and information networks project



in this project, we would like to analyze the impact
of COVID-19 on international trade by comparing the different network analysis measures on pre covid
and post covid global trade data. This would help us to conclude the impact of COVID-19 on the trade which
plays a major role in countries' growth and relations among the countries.
